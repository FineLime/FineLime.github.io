			<h1>What Is LimeBot?</h1>
			<p>Limebot is a multipurpose discord bot coded by Lime#6045 (Joshua Brown) and has moderation, reactionrole and fun commands.<br>A lot of features are still to come to LimeBot in the future so make sure to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/r5NmHjB">discord sever</a> to be informed of new updates.</p>
			<h1>Why I Made LimeBot</h1>
			<p>I made LimeBot for fun, at first it was just fun and was only designed to work properly on a single server, but after a few months I decided to rewrite Limebot to make it into a better bot and work on all servers. I'm currently still in the progress of rewriting LimeBot and adding new features.</p>
			<h1>Why You Should Use LimeBot</h1>
			<p>Using LimeBot will allow you to have less discord bots in your server as LimeBot is multi-purpose and can replace reactionrole bots, moderation bots and others which just does general fun commands.<br>LimeBot's goal is to be able to replace all other bots and become the ruler of bots... well.. not really but LimeBot has lots of features and commands which you can find in <a href="docs.html">the documentation</a> and if you have questions you can check out the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.gg/r5NmHjB">discord server.</a></p>
